Makefiles:
	a todo target showing all todos in source files
	Master makefile: don't copy files if other makefiles return "up to date"

Bootloader:
	Possibily make the EFI SystemTable a global variable?
	make Bootloader makefile independent of makefile.variables. This involves:
		Copying relevant CFLAGS from https://wiki.osdev.org/User:No92/UEFI_Bare_Bones to the makefile
		Deleting all the CFLAGS in makefile.variables and replacing it with poncho's
