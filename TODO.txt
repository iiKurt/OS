Makefiles:
	a todo target showing all todos in source files
	include directories in CFLAGS (-I)
	"you shouldn't be invoking ld directly in the first place, but rather linking with your cross-compiler"
	make Bootloader makefile independent of makefile.variables

General:
	Title Case for filenames
	>>>>> Use "" instead of <> where possible <<<<<
		Then remove -Isource or -I$(SOURCEDIR) from indivdual makefiles
		Then have -ISource/Shared in makefile.variables

Bootloader:
	Seperate stuff into distinct files
