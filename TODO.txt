Generic:
	Formatting guidelines
		Style/naming convention of function names and class member variables
		Comment formatting
			Start comment with captial and space after the //, end with .
			/* must have newline after, */ must have newline before
	Unit testing
	Move away from deprecated std headers, will mean prefixing a few things with std::

Makefiles:
	have the path to makefile.variables be an environment variable so sub-makefiles don't need to do ../.. (makes calling sub-makefiles far easier, no -C option)
	a todo target showing all todos in source files
	a release target that cleans and builds the OS with optimizations enabled
	Master makefile - don't copy files if:
		other makefiles return "up to date"
		or if a bundled resource modification date is same or older than destination

Bootloader:
	Possibily make the EFI SystemTable a global variable?
	make Bootloader makefile independent of makefile.variables? This involves:
		Copying relevant CFLAGS from https://wiki.osdev.org/User:No92/UEFI_Bare_Bones to the makefile
		Deleting all the CFLAGS in makefile.variables and replacing it with poncho's

Kernel:
	Print a buildstamp on boot (build stamp of whole OS or just kernel?)
