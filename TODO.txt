Makefiles:
	a todo target showing all todos in source files

Bootloader:
	Seperate stuff into distinct files
	make Bootloader makefile independent of makefile.variables. This involves:
		Copying relevant CFLAGS from https://wiki.osdev.org/User:No92/UEFI_Bare_Bones to the makefile
		Deleting all the CFLAGS in makefile.variables and replacing it with poncho's
