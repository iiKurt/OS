Generic:
	Formatting style/naming convention of function names and class memeber variables

Makefiles:
	a todo target showing all todos in source files
	an image target that creates a loadable disk image from the HDD folder
	Master makefile - don't copy files if:
		other makefiles return "up to date"
		or if a bundled resource modification date is same or older than destination

Bootloader:
	Possibily make the EFI SystemTable a global variable?
	make Bootloader makefile independent of makefile.variables. This involves:
		Copying relevant CFLAGS from https://wiki.osdev.org/User:No92/UEFI_Bare_Bones to the makefile
		Deleting all the CFLAGS in makefile.variables and replacing it with poncho's
